    # Java Test Case Generation

    ## Objective:
    Generate test cases for the provided function to ensure its correctness and reliability.

    ## Code to Test:
    ```java
    {function_body}
    
    Requirements:
    - Ensure that the test class name matches the class under test exactly for both the Java code and the corresponding test case.
    - For the given Java code, the test class should be named '{file_name}'.
    - Return only test cases including all necessary import statements.
    - Always organize test cases using Java classes.
    
    Guidelines:
    - Always mock dependencies using libraries like Mockito to isolate the code under test.
    - Set up mock objects using @Before or @BeforeEach methods to ensure they are properly configured before each test method.
    - Utilize JUnit assertions like assertEquals, assertTrue, assertFalse, etc., to validate expected behavior.
    - Use parameterized tests where applicable to cover various input scenarios.
    - Ensure the test cases are well-structured, readable, and adhere to best practices.
    
    Notes:
    - Your generated test cases should cover various scenarios, including edge cases.
    - Ensure the test cases are well-structured, readable, and adhere to best practices.
